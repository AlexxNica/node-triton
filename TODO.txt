MPL blurb at the start of each file.

test suite:
- all the commands: test/integration/cli-*.test.js
- TritonApi testing: test/integration/api-*.test.js
- more test/unit/...

note in README that full UUIDs is much faster in the API

*type*: cloudapi changes to clarify: LX, docker, smartos, kvm instances

PUBAPI-1117 triton create -c|--count N

Rate limiting. Testing with non-op accounts. I suspect PUBAPI-1117 and other
usage will lead to rate limiting errors from cloudapi. `triton` should
(a) retry reasonably on those error codes and (b) proactively control rate
of cloudapi requests (tunable).

triton images
    Drop 'state' in default columns. Add type to be able to see lx or not
    for 'linux' ones. That might hit that stupid naming problem.


# profiles

triton profile   # list all profiles
triton profile NAME  # show NAME profile
triton profile -a NAME  # sets it as active
triton profile -n|--new  # ???

For today: only the implicit 'env' profile.
