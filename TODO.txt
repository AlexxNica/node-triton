12 char shortids (matches docker)


# maybe next

bash completion (subcmd options)
bash completion (cached data: insts, imgs, pkgs, names and ids)

PUBAPI-1117 triton create -c|--count N

# profiles

triton profile   # list all profiles
triton profile NAME  # show NAME profile
triton profile -a NAME  # sets it as active
triton profile -n|--new  # ???

For today: only the implicit 'env' profile.

~/.triton/
    config.json
