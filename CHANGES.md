# node-triton changelog

# 2.0.0

- Changed name to `triton` npm package, graciously given up by
  [suguru](https://www.npmjs.com/~suguru) from his
  <https://github.com/ameba-proteus/node-triton> project. <3
  The latest previous release of the triton package was 1.0.7,
  so we'll separate with a major version bump for *this* triton
  package.

# 1.0.0

Initial release as `joyent-triton` npm package.
